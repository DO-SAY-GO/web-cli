# Overview

**web --help**:

```text
web - `web` controls a real Chromium or Firefox browser session over CDP and BiDi. Running `web inspect` returns a numbered action sheet — stable refs you click, type into, and act on without writing selectors. Refs reset after page-state changes; re-inspect before the next action to get fresh numbers.

Usage:
  web [--json|--no-json|--text] [--profile <name>] [--frame <frame>] <command>
  web          (no command — opens an interactive REPL)

Core commands:
  go              Navigate or move through history. --new opens in a new tab.
  inspect         List numbered actions on the page. <query> can be a ref number, visible text, or a selector: prefix.
  do              Run a numbered action. <query> is a ref number (3), visible text (Submit), or selector: prefix.
  click           Click a matched element. <query> is a ref number, visible text (e.g. Issues, Submit), or selector: prefix. Bare numbers are refs; use text:<n> to match a numeric label. Omit query with --coords to click at absolute page coordinates.
  type            Type into a field. -t / --target accepts a text label or CSS selector.
  read            Read page text or a target region.
  status          Show session and page state.
  find            Find matching elements or tabs. <query> is visible text (e.g. Submit, Issues), a ref number, or a selector: prefix. Returns a numbered ref sheet — text matches may return multiple results; act on the ref if unambiguous, or use --all to see every match.
  form            List visible form fields.
  submit          Submit the nearest form.
  press           Send a key press.
  keydown         Hold a key down without releasing.
  keyup           Release a held key. Pairs with keydown.
  pointerdown     Press pointer down without releasing (starts drag or long-press).
  pointermove     Move pointer while held (continues drag).
  pointerup       Release pointer (ends drag or long-press). Pairs with pointerdown.
  say             Paste text into the focused element. Click to focus first if needed.
  clear           Clear an editable target.
  choose          Choose a native select option.
  switch          Switch tabs or frames. Both 'web switch tab N' and 'web tab switch N' are accepted.
  tab             Manage tabs.
  frame           Manage frames.
  profiles        Manage profiles. A profile is a named directory holding browsing data and daemon state. Ephemeral profiles start fresh each session. Named profiles persist across sessions. Temporary profiles are named but self-destruct on 'web quit'. The user-default profile copies your real browser's cookies and sessions for sites that need established trust.
  scroll          Scroll the page or bring a match into view. <query> is a ref number or visible text. Bare numbers are refs; use text:<number> to match numeric labels.
  back            Go back in history.
  forward         Go forward in history.
  reload          Reload the tab.
  quit            Stop the local browser session (or all/specific profiles). Temporary profiles are deleted on quit.
